pip install pandas --> to install library
pip install --uppgrade pandas --> to update library

1. Pandas: open source data analysis library
2. We use pandas instead of excel cuz we can use python functions and ML technologies provided, hence can do better analysis
3. also some limitations in excel like limit of data in a cell
4. It leverages the power and speed of numpy (numpy is fast and gives better storage) to make data analysis and preprocessing easy for data scientists
5. provides rich and highly robust data operations

--> Pandas has 2 type Data Structures:
        - Series(1D) = one dim array with indexes, it stores a single column or row of data in Dataframe
        - Dataframe(2D) = tabular spreadsheet like struct representing rows each of which contains one or multiple columns
    - 1D arr capable of holding any type of data (Series contains same datatype)
    - 2D arr with columns of potentially diff data type (DF contains columns of diff datatype)
    -train is a DF
        - type(train['Speed']) --> will give type of series as speed is a column of train DF
        - type(train) --> will give type DF
    
--> Jupyter Notebook is good for data analysis.
